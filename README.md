# Real-Time Agent for latency-sensitive scenarios

A comprehensive reference design and Python implementation for building real-time AI agents using Azure OpenAI or AI Foundry. This repository provides architecture patterns, best practices, and production-ready code for implementing conversational AI agents with real-time streaming capabilities.


## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build scalable, real-time multi-agent solutions that can:
- Handle streaming responses for immediate user feedback in latency-sensitive environments (call center, customer service, etc.)
- Support multi-modal inputs and outputs (text, voice, and images) using the latest AI models from Azure OpenAI or AI Foundry
- Provide a comprehensive observability framework to cover classical application monitoring and agent-specific monitoring requirements
- Ensure security and compliance by default with data handling best practices
- Scale for production use cases
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing agent definitions, configurations, and states at scale

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: Implements real-time streaming of multi-modal inputs and responses to enhance user experience in latency-sensitive applications.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Supports multiple agents working collaboratively to handle complex tasks and workflows.
- **Observability**: Includes logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities to ensure system reliability and performance across all agents.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensures data handling best practices are followed by default.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale for production use cases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for managing agent definitions, configurations, and states at scale.
