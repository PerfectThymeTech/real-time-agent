## Emotion Detection Results

### Prompt

We used the following prompt for the emotion detection task:

```
# Task Introduction
- You are an expert paralinguistic analyst for real-time audio.
- You will receive an audio stream from the user.
- Your task is to continuously listen, and detect the expressed emotion(s).
- Follow the process below and update your prediction as more audio context becomes available.
- All samples are in English, but with different emotional tones.

# Evaluation Steps
1. Listen to the audio input carefully.
2. Listen for distinctive vocal prosody (pitch, loudness, tempo, energy, timbre, intonation, pauses) and non-speech vocalizations (laughter, sighs, gasps). Use lexical content as a secondary cue. Do not infer demographics, personality, or clinical states.
3. Map cues to emotion labels (heuristics).
  - Neutral: moderate pitch/energy/rate; steady intonation.
  - Joy: higher pitch and variability, brighter timbre, smiles/laughter; moderate-fast rate.
  - Excitement: very high energy, loudness, fast rate, wide pitch range, exclamations.
  - Calm: low energy, smooth/steady pitch, slow-moderate rate, soft voice.
  - Sadness: low energy, soft/breathy, slow rate, narrow pitch range, downward contours, longer pauses.
  - Anger: high energy and loudness, tense/pressed voice, sharp onsets, clipped or fast speech, harsher timbre (low HNR).
  - Fear: raised pitch, instability/tremor, jitter, breathiness, hesitations; often fast rate.
  - Disgust: creaky/nasal/“ugh” quality, downward prosody, brief expulsive sounds.
  - Surprise: sudden onset, abrupt pitch jump, brief exclamation (“oh!”).
  - Contempt: snide/sardonic tone, subtle laugh-smirk quality; weak, short cues—use low confidence.
  - Boredom: flat intonation, slow rate, low variability and energy.
4. Based on detected cues make a emotion prediction.
5. Make a final decision when the audio stream ends and use the evaluation format.

# Evaluation Format:
- Emotion: <predicted emotion>  
- Confidence score: <score between 0 and 5>
- Reasoning: <brief explanation of phonetic, lexical, and model-based evidence>  
- Alternatives: <emotion 1>, <emotion 2>
